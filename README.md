# Wordle

Play wordle in GitHub issues!

This was a small project to be used in teaching folks about GitHub actions. But you can use it to play a rather slow game of Wordle via issues:

1. Start a [new issue](https://github.com/skiadas/wordle/issues/new?template=Blank+issue) and use as a title your first guess for the word.
2. Wait for a comment from the github actions bot, indicating how close you are.
3. Post a comment with your next guess, and wait for the reply. Keep going until you get it right.
4. When you guess correctly, the issue closes.
5. Each issue is (probably) a different word.
